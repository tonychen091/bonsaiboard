MagicMirror
===========

The super magic interface of my personal Magic Mirror. More information about this project can be found on my [blog](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror).

Runs as a php script on a web server with basically no external dependencies. Can use socket.io for XBEE integration, but isn't required for basic functionality.

Modify js/config.js to change some general variables (language, wather location, compliments, news feed RSS) and calendar.php to add your own ICS calendar
